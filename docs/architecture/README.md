# Service Fabric Core Subsystem Architecture

Service Fabric is composed of several subsystems working together to achieve the promise of the platform: to remove the complexities of distributed computing from developers who want to build highly available, resilient, and massively scalable cloud services across public and private clouds, and operating systems. 

As you can see, it takes a lot of code to materialize Service Fabric. To make it easier to wander around the codebase, just click on a subsystem below and you will be taken directly to its top level source folder, which will include some useful information about what the subsystem does. 

Enjoy your travels through the code and thank you for jumping in. We really look forward to your contributions and feedback. (NOTE: Please view this page in Desktop mode on your mobile device, otherwise the table formatting is funky...).
