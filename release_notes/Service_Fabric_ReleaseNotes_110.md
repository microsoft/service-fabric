## Service Fabric Feature and Bug Fixes

| **Versions** | **Issue Type** | **Description** | **Resolution** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | KVS EnableOverwriteOnUpdate setting | **Brief Description:** Removed KVS EnableOverwriteOnUpdate setting, as it had no benefit when enabled. This setting allowed the KVS database to overwrite removed long values without using a new LVID (Long Value ID). However, it resulted in slower transaction times. The setting was originally added to help mitigate LVID exhaustion issues, however other fixes have done a better job to help in this regard without the notable downside this setting has. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Enabling EnableOverwriteOnUpdate would cause slower transaction times by up to 20%. <br> **Solution/Fix:** Removed setting. Now acts as if always set to false. <br> **Breaking Change:** EnableOverwriteOnUpdate setting removed <br> **Workaround**: Set EnableOverwriteOnUpdate to false |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | VC Runtime 11 dependecy | **Brief Description:** Removed VC Runtime 11 dependency from SF Runtime, which is currently out of support <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Out of support VC runtime .dll in the SF runtime   <br> **Solution/Fix:** Upgraded the ese.dll, which now depends on VC runtime 14.0 |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | CNG support | **Brief Description:** In this release we enabled runtime CNG support. CNG support enhances the fundamental security stance of the product. SF certificates can now be installed with increased security. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** SF certificates can now be installed with increased security. Before this change, deprecated and less secure Crypto API was being used for all cryptographic operations. <br> **Solution/Fix:** Use CNG for all cryptography related operations including key generation and access. CAPI keys are still supported as they were. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Service Fabric Runtime for Linux | **Brief Description:** Service Fabric Runtime for Linux updated its .NET dependency from 6 to 8. This cause .NET 8 to be installed on the system instead of .NET 6. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** This make it so Service Fabric for Linux continues to use a support .NET. <br> **Solution/Fix:** Updates the dependencies that Service Fabric for Linux has on installing its DEB package to specify .NET 8 packages instead of .NET 6 packages. <br> **Breaking Change:** It's possible this will break customers who aren't installing .NET 6 to support their own applications.  |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Service Fabric Remoting | **Brief Description:** See documentation reference. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Service Fabric Remoting <br> **Solution/Fix:** Removing V1 is deprecated, Removing V2 is used by default. <br> **Documentation Reference**: https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric/blob/master/release_notes/Deprecated/RemotingV1.md <br> **Breaking Change:** Yes. Customers upgrading applications to SDK version 8 will use Remoting V2_1 by default unless they have explicitly specified it. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Obsolete test APIs | **Brief Description:** Remove obsolete Invoke-ServiceFabricPartitionDataLoss and Invoke-ServiceFabricPartitionQuorumLoss powershell commands and test APIs. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Obsolete APIs are no longer available. <br> **Solution/Fix:** Use Start-ServiceFabricPartitionDataLoss or Start-ServiceFabricPartitionQuorumLoss commands in combination with the Get-ServiceFabricPartitionDataLossProgress or Get-ServiceFabricPartitionQuorumLossProgress commands. <br> **Documentation Reference**: PowerShell and API docs will be generated after release. <br> **Breaking Change:** Yes |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Microsoft.ServiceFabric NuGet package | **Brief Description:** The managed assemblies Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Internal.dll and Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Internal.Strings.dll are mostly a subset of the System.Fabric.dll and System.Fabric.Strings.dll. They have been removed from the Microsoft.ServiceFabric NuGet package. The System.Fabric assemblies from this package are now used instead. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Reduction in the number of Service Fabric Runtime and application dependencies, disk and memory consumption. <br> **Solution/Fix:** Unnecessary assemblies have been removed. <br> **Breaking Change:** This change has no effect on the existing applications built with the older versions of the Microsoft.ServiceFabric package. However, when upgrading to the next major version of this package some customers may encounter build errors if they are using assembly Reference elements in old-style MSBuild version 4 projects that were common for building .NET Framework 4.x applications. While for most external customers, Reference elements to the Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Internal assemblies will be removed automatically by the NuGet package manager during Microsoft.ServiceFabric package upgrade, those customers who edit their project files by hand would have to manually remove these references.  |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Reliable Collection API | **Brief Description:** Added Reliable Collection API to Remove Key Value Pair without disk read <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:**  All managed Reliable Collections users <br> **Solution/Fix:** Call internal TStore API ConditionalRemoveAsync with configuration to turn off performVersionCheck and set read mode to ReadMode.Off would ensure that disk would not be read with the added API. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Bug | ManagedIdentityTokenService | **Brief Description:** In this release we fixed a bug where ManagedIdentityTokenService could provide different applications with the same token, if they have the same managed identity and resource ID. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** ManagedIdentityTokenService could provide the wrong token to the application. <br> **Solution/Fix:** ManagedIdentityTokenService caches tokens based on the application resource ID, as well. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Bug | ManagedIdentityTokenService | **Brief Description:** In this release we fixed a bug where ManagedIdentityTokenService could fail to update its certificate, causing managed identity token requests to fail unexpectedly. With this update, ManagedIdentityTokenService ensures that it always uses the most up-to-date certificate. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** ManagedIdentityTokenService requests could sometimes fail unexpectedly. <br> **Solution/Fix:** HttpGatewayClient is instantiated with the up-to-date certificate every time when communication with FabricGateway is initiated. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Backup Restore System (BRS) | **Brief Description:** The Backup Restore Service provides robust and reliable mechanisms for backing up and restoring stateful services. It ensures data durability and availability by allowing users to create backups of their service states and restore them in the event of failures or during routine maintenance. This service is vital for maintaining business continuity and minimizing downtime. <br> <br> **Increased RestoreTimeout:** We have increased the default RestoreTimeout from 10 minutes to 30 minutes to allow more time for the completion of restore operations <br> - New Default RestoreTimeout: 30 minutes <br> - This change will help prevent multiple restore attempts and ensure a smoother restore process for users. <br> <br> **Benefit:** Improved efficiency and fewer timeouts with the increased RestoreTimeout. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Backup Restore System (BRS) | **Brief Description:** The Backup Restore Service provides robust and reliable mechanisms for backing up and restoring stateful services. It ensures data durability and availability by allowing users to create backups of their service states and restore them in the event of failures or during routine maintenance. This service is vital for maintaining business continuity and minimizing downtime. <br> <br> **SecondariesInProgress**: We have introduced a new state called SecondariesInProgress in the restore progress. This state helps to provide more precise information about the progress of the restore operation: <br> - SecondariesInProgress: This new state indicates that the primary replica has been successfully restored, and the restoration of secondary replicas is currently in progress (Partition’s quorum not recovered yet). <br> <br> **Benefit:** Enhanced transparency in the restore process with the new SecondaryInProgress state. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | win32 Logon Type | **Brief Description:** Allow specifying win32 user logon type for User model in manifest to help with capturing of fast-fail dumps per request from SQL. Possible values to UserLogonType are NetworkClearText, Batch and Interactive. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Added new UserLogonType attribute to User in manifest schema. The value of this attribute corresponds to [win32 logon type enums](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-logonuserexa). UserLogonType is a superset of PerformInteractiveLogon. It gives more control on what user logon type should be used to activate the application. Default value is NetworkClearText (no default behavior change). <br> **Solution/Fix:** Since UserLogonType attribute has a default value of NetworkClearText, if customer specifies PerformInteractiveLogon=true then Interactive logon will be used (no behavior change since previous SF version). If customer specifies any UserLogonType then it will take precedence over PerformInteractiveLogon. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Version string | **Brief Description:** Beginning with this release we have change our version string to align with [SemVer2.0.0](https://semver.org/). This aligns us with industrial standards in terms of version information. We also change our policy to align the CU number to be the minor version. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Previously when we released the version string used both the major and minor values as the major value. Going forward we have separated this. A minor version greater than 0 indicates it is a CU and the value of the minor version is the CU number. For example when we release CU3 of v11 the version string will start with 11.3. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Visual C++ runtime .dlls | **Brief Description:** Several Visual C++ runtime .dlls are no longer used by the Service Fabric and no longer installed. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** Applications that require these .dlls but don't deploy them in their application packages may encounter runtime errors when attempting to load them. <br> msvcr110.dll <br> msvcp110.dll <br> **Solution/Fix:** Applications that require these .dlls must include them in their application packages. <br> **Breaking Change:** May be a breaking change for applications that require these .dlls and don't include them in their application packages.  |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | Image Store provider | **Brief Description:** There is a security mandate for customers to eliminate local authorization (access keys) for their storage accounts. XStore (external store), which is a legacy SF storage mechanism to store ImageStore data, uses SAK-based connection. <br> <br> On 07/30/2025, we'll retire XStore as the [Image Store provider](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https:%2f%2fgithub.com%2fMicrosoftDocs%2fazure-compute-docs%2fblob%2fmain%2farticles%2fservice-fabric%2fservice-fabric-image-store-connection-string.md&data=05%7c02%7cAnkur.Jain%40microsoft.com%7cccb35840c31f41b3b2da08dd77b53fe2%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1%7c0%7c638798342627663170%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=94svaLhqss0fXB7R20cQPedI3fWn2kqik2xrFg1P1D4%3D&reserved=0). Before that date, you need to move your workloads to the [native Image Store Service](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https:%2f%2fgithub.com%2fAzure%2fService-Fabric-Troubleshooting-Guides%2fblob%2fmaster%2fDeployment%2fHow%2520to%2520Migrate%2520from%2520XStore%2520to%2520the%2520Native%2520Image%2520Store%2520Service.md&data=05%7c02%7cAnkur.Jain%40microsoft.com%7cccb35840c31f41b3b2da08dd77b53fe2%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1%7c0%7c638798342627679367%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=IkcjlMqIrBk60btnxCMwZgJY8pIx2ASmj9TUjPIacWA%3D&reserved=0). The native Image Store Service offers key benefits: <br> - Eliminates external dependencies for the package repository by hosting Image Store in a system service within the cluster, giving better control over storage locality. <br> - Enhances security, as XStore’s SAK-based connection has been identified as a security compliance issue. <br> <br> After 07/30/2025, any workloads that still use XStore as Image Store provider will be unable to upgrade their clusters to latest Service Fabric versions to consume improvements. Also, XStore will not be supported as Image Store provider and will stop working entirely post SF 11.2 <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** XStore’s SAK-based connection has been flagged by the Secure Future Initiative, which prioritizes addressing cybersecurity threats. <br> **Solution/Fix:** To avoid service disruptions, move your workloads to the native Image Store Service before 07/30/2025. <br> **Documentation Reference:** [How to Migrate from XStore to the Native Image Store Service Service-Fabric-Troubleshooting-Guides](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https:%2f%2fgithub.com%2fAzure%2fService-Fabric-Troubleshooting-Guides%2fblob%2fmaster%2fDeployment%2fHow%2520to%2520Migrate%2520from%2520XStore%2520to%2520the%2520Native%2520Image%2520Store%2520Service.md&data=05%7c02%7cAnkur.Jain%40microsoft.com%7cccb35840c31f41b3b2da08dd77b53fe2%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1%7c0%7c638798342627717504%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=Vir3KmwCuDwvWmC1YVuqWFcfKgaU8bMYhvIFe%2Bw%2fstE%3D&reserved=0) |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | MR communication | **Brief Description:** Migrated the MR communication between the Service Fabric Infrastructure Service and wireserver from the zerosdk bond endpoint to the mrendpoint protobuf endpoint. This migration addresses security risks associated with the bond library, which is being deprecated. <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** By default, the mrdocument endpoint and protobuf protocol will now be used for MR communication. <br> **Solution/Fix:** The changes have been implemented to use the new mrdocument protobuf wireserver endpoint by default for MR communication. In case of failure, there is a fallback flow to use the zerosdk endpoint. Additionally, a feature flag 'Azure.EnableProtobufMRCommunication' of type bool has been added to enable or disable the new mrdocument protobuf wireserver endpoint. By default, this flag is enabled, and the protobuf endpoint will be used. <br> **Breaking Change:** During the migration from the bond to the protobuf endpoint, several repair types, repair requests, and properties have been deprecated: <br> 1. Deprecated repair maintenance types: Exclude, HostEnvironmentUpdate, TenantInitiatedGuestAndHostUpdate. <br> 2. Deprecated commands for repair jobs: RequestSuspend, RequestResume, RequestRollback. <br> 3. The GetDocRaw payload has been changed to return the policy agent document for the tenant in its original binary form. With the migration to protobuf, the raw document will now be in protobuf format. |
| Windows - <br> 11.0.2707.1 <br> Ubuntu 20 - <br> 11.0.2707.3 <br> Ubuntu 22 - <br> 11.0.2707.4 | Feature | PowerShell cmdlets | **Brief Description:** Upcoming Breaking Change for Replica Management Cmdlets and APIs <br> <br> Applies to: Service Fabric 11.2 and later <br> <br> In Service Fabric 11.1, the following PowerShell cmdlets will be marked as deprecated and will begin the process of removal in future releases: <br> [Remove-ServiceFabricReplica](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/servicefabric/remove-servicefabricreplica) <br> [Restart-ServiceFabricReplica](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/servicefabric/restart-servicefabricreplica) <br> Using these cmdlets after version 11.1 will produce warnings. Full removal of support is expected in a later release. <br> <br> In addition, equivalent C# and REST APIs are also being planned for deprecation, with alternate APIs to be announced in future: <br> [FabricClient.FaultManagementClient.RemoveReplicaAsync Method (System.Fabric) - Azure for .NET Developers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.faultmanagementclient.removereplicaasync?view=azure-dotnet) <br> [FabricClient.FaultManagementClient.RestartNodeAsync Method (System.Fabric) - Azure for .NET Developers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.faultmanagementclient.restartnodeasync?view=azure-dotnet) <br> [Remove Replica](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/servicefabric/sfclient-api-removereplica) <br> [Restart Replica](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/servicefabric/sfclient-api-restartreplica) <br> <br> Migration path: Service Fabric 11.1 introduces new cmdlets and a compatibility switch to ensure that existing automation continues to function after upgrading to version 11.2, where the breaking changes will take effect. <br> Details on replacements and migration steps will be included in the 11.1 release notes and documentation. <br> <br> **Feature/Bug Impact:** PowerShell automation and API integrations involving replica removal and restart <br> Scripts and tools relying on the deprecated cmdlets may fail in Service Fabric versions 11.2 and later. <br> Customers should begin transitioning to the new cmdlets and APIs as soon as they become available to avoid disruptions in future upgrades. |

## Retirement and Deprecation Path Callouts

* Service Fabric (SF) runtime will discontinue support for the Java SDK soon. For a smooth transition, we strongly recommend users to shift to Azure Service Fabric .NET SDK. If your current setup is based on the Service Fabric Java SDK, we suggest starting migration plans to smoothly switch to the Azure Service Fabric .NET SDK. Although applications using the Java SDK will continue to work, we highly recommend adopting the SF .NET SDK for optimal outcomes.

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS reached its 5-year end-of-life window on June-2023. Service Fabric runtime has dropped support for 18.04 LTS after the published date, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to supported versions listed here: [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions)

* Service Fabric runtime will soon be archiving and removing Service Fabric runtime versions less than 7.2 and older, as well as the corresponding SDK version 4.2 packages and older from the package Download Center. Archiving/Removing will affect application scaling and re-imaging of virtual machines in a Service Fabric Cluster running on unsupported versions. After older versions are removed/archived, this may cause failure while rolling back when the current in-progress upgrade has errors.
  * To prevent disruption of workloads, create a new cluster using the following steps:
    * [Create a Service Fabric cluster using ARM template](/azure/service-fabric/quickstart-cluster-template)
    * [Create a Standalone cluster](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-for-windows-server)
    * Install the supported version of Service Fabric SDK based on the Runtime version installed on the cluster.
