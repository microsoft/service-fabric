## Service Fabric Feature and Bug Fixes
This release includes quality improvements only and does not contain bug fixes to specific issue.

## Retirement and Deprecation Path Callouts
* Service Fabric ASP.NET Core packages built against ASP.NET Core 1.0 binaries are out of support. Starting Service Fabric 8.2, we will be building Service Fabric ASP.NET Core packages for .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5.0, .NET 6.0, .NET Framework 4.6.1. As a result, they can be used only to build services targeting .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5.0, .NET 6.0, >=.NET Framework 4.6.1 respectively.<br>
For .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5.0, .NET 6.0, Service Fabric ASP.NET Core will be taking dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.App shared framework; whereas, for NetFx target frameworks >=.NET Framework 4.6.1, Service Fabric ASP.NET Core will be taking dependency on ASP.NET Core 2.1 packages.
The package Microsoft.ServiceFabric.AspNetCore.WebListener will no longer be shipped, Microsoft.ServiceFabric.AspNetCore.HttpSys package should be used instead.
* .Net Core 2.1 is out of support as of August 2021. Applications running on .net core 2.1 and lower will stop working from Service Fabric release 10 in Feb 2023. Please migrate to a higher supported version at the earliest.
* .NET 5.0 runtime has reached end-of-life on May 8, 2022. Service Fabric releases after this date will drop support for Service Fabric applications running with .NET 5.0 runtime. Current applications running on .NET 5.0 runtime will continue to work, but requests for investigations or requests for changes will no longer be entertained. Please migrate to using .NET 6.0 version instead.
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS reached its 5-year end-of-life window on April 30, 2021. Service Fabric runtime has dropped support for 16.04 LTS, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to supported versions listed here: [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions#supported-linux-versions-and-support-end-date)<br>
Applications running on 16.04 will continue to work, but requests to investigate issues w.r.t this OS or requests for change will no longer be entertained. Service Fabric runtime has also dropped producing builds for U16.04 so customers will no longer be able to get SF related patches.
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will reach its 5-year end-of-life window on April 30, 2023. Service Fabric runtime will drop support for 18.04 LTS after the published date, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to supported versions listed here: [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions#supported-linux-versions-and-support-end-date)
* Service Fabric runtime will soon stop supporting BinaryFormatter based remoting exception serialization by default and move to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception serialization by default. Current applications using it will continue to work as-is, but Service Fabric strongly recommends moving to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception instead.
* Service Fabric runtime will soon be archiving and removing Service Fabric runtime version 6.4 packages and older, as well as SDK version 3.3 packages and older from the package Download Center. Archiving/Removing will affect application scaling and re-imaging of virtual machines in a Service Fabric Cluster running on unsupported versions. After older versions are removed/archived, this may cause failure while rolling back when the current in-progress upgrade has errors.
* Migrate Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) library to Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) library, since ADAL will be out of support after December 2022. This will impact customers using AAD for authentication in Service Fabric for below features:<ul><li>Powershell, StandAlone Service Fabric Explorer(SFX), TokenValicationService</li><li>FabricBRS using AAD for keyvault authentication</li><li>KeyVaultWrapper</li><li>ms.test.winfabric.current test framework</li><li>KXM tool</li><li>AzureClusterDeployer tool</li></ul>For more information see: [MSAL Migration] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-migration)
