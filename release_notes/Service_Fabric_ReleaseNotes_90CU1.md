## Retirement and Deprecation Path Callouts
* Service Fabric ASP.NET Core packages built against ASP.NET Core 1.0 binaries are out of support. Starting Service Fabric 8.2, we will be building Service Fabric ASP.NET Core packages against .NET Core 3.1, .NET Core 5.0, .NET Core 6.0, .NET Framework 4.6.1. As a result, they can be used only to build services targeting .NET Core 3.1, .NET Core 5.0, .NET Core 6.0, >=.NET Framework 4.6.1 respectively.
For .NET Core 3.1, .NET Core 5.0, .NET Core 6.0, Service Fabric ASP.NET Core will be taking dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.App shared framework; whereas, for NetFx target frameworks >=.NET Framework 4.6.1, Service Fabric ASP.NET Core will be taking dependency on ASP.NET Core 2.1 packages.
The package Microsoft.ServiceFabric.AspNetCore.WebListener will no longer be shipped, Microsoft.ServiceFabric.AspNetCore.HttpSys package should be used instead.
* .NET Core runtime LTS 2.1 runtime will go out of support from Aug 21, 2021. Service Fabric releases after that date will drop support for Service Fabric apps running with .NET Core 2.1 runtime. Service Fabric .NET SDK will take a dependency on .Net runtime 3.* features to support Service Fabric .NET Core apps.  This has no impact on Service Fabric .NET Framework SDK.
* .NET 5.0 runtime is reaching end-of-life on May 8, 2022.Service Fabric releases after that date will drop support for Service Fabric applications running with .NET 5.0 runtime.Current applications running on .NET 5.0 runtime will continue to work, but requests for investigations or request for changes will no longer be entertained. Please migrate to using .NET 6.0 version instead.
*  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS reached its 5-year end-of-life window on April 30, 2021.Service Fabric runtime has dropped support for 16.04 LTS, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS.Current applications running on it will continue to work, but requests for investigations or requests for change will no longer be entertained. Please migrate to Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 instead.
* Service Fabric runtime will soon be stop using BinaryFormatter based remoting exception serialization by default and move to using Data Contract Serilization (DCS) based remoting exception serialization by default.Current applications using it will continue to work as-is, but Service Fabric strongly recommends moving to using Data Contract Serilization (DCS) based remoting exception instead.
* Service Fabric runtime will soon be archiving and removing Service Fabric runtime version 6.4 packages and older, as well as SDK version 3.3 packages and older from the package Download Center.
