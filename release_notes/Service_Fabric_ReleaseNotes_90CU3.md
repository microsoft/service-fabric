## Breaking Changes
Customers running Azure Service Fabric Linux Clusters will not be able to scale out or reimage (manual or auto via VMSS OS Image Update) nodes or create new Linux clusters without first upgrading to Service Fabric version 9.0.1086.1. Also, if your application requires JDK, then you will need to install a JDK of your choice since SF will not install the JDK as part of the SF installation.
Starting 8/19/2022, the following versions have been deprecated and will not be available on Linux for new cluster creation or node reimage/scale out operations:<br>
* 9.0 CU2/CU1/RTO
* 8.2 CU4/CU3/CU2.1/CU2/CU1/RTO<br>

**Details:** Service Fabric Runtime (for Linux) placed a dependency on Zulu for Azure build of OpenJDK which is no longer supported as announced in their dev [blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/end-of-updates-support-and-availability-of-zulu-for-azure/). Since the creation of new Linux clusters or scale-out/reimage of nodes required all the dependencies to be installed, these workflows broke when the dependency became unavailable.<br>
Beginning with 9.0 CU 2.1 release, Service Fabric Runtime will no longer install any JDK dependency which will ensure that customer can scale out, reimage, or create new Linux clusters. If your application needs JDK, please utilize an alternate mechanism to provision a JDK. To get the latest Service Fabric Runtime releases with this change, follow the upgrade documentation. If you depend on a JDK, please be sure to install one of your choice.<br>

**Breaking Changes with  BackupRestoreService**
When SF cluster is upgraded to to 9.0.1107.9590 which has existing backup policies and these are enabled on any of the app/service/partition, post upgradation BRS fails deserialize old metadata with changes in new release. It will stop taking backup and restore on the partition/service/app in question, though cluster and BRS remains healthy. Customers would see logs something like â€“
| Timestamp | Type | Process | Thread | Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-10-18T11:14:18.44Z | BackupRestoreManager | 92384 | 576992 | 2f2f40a4-b8a6-416b-98c2-939ea60b0d77 Error encountered in BackupRestoreWorker InitializeAsync System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException: Error in line 1 position 198. 'Element' '_x003C_NumberOfBackupsInChain_x003E_k__BackingField' from namespace 'http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/System.Fabric.BackupRestore' is not expected. Expecting element '_x003C_NextBackupTime_x003E_k__BackingField'.<br>    	   at System.Runtime.Serialization.XmlObjectSerializerReadContext.ThrowRequiredMemberMissingException(XmlReaderDelegator xmlReader, Int32 memberIndex, Int32 requiredIndex, XmlDictionaryString[] memberNames)|

**Mitigation**
To mitigate, customers need to update the existing policy after upgrading to 9.0.1107.9590. User can call updatebackuppolicy API as mentioned in this doc [Update Backup Policy] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/servicefabric/sfclient-api-updatebackuppolicy with existing policy values. It will update the policy model inside BRS with new data model and BRS will start taking periodic backups again.
**Steps**
1. Check if there were some existing backup policies applied on any application/service/partition before upgrading to 9.0.1107.9590
2. Check if periodic backups are stopped post upgrading and above error is appearing in logs.
above errors are appearing
3. Update the backup policy with same old values by calling updatebackuppolicy API. Below is one sample -
    ```powershell
     $BackupPolicy=@{
      Name = "DailyAzureBackupPolicy"
      AutoRestoreOnDataLoss = "false"
      MaxIncrementalBackups = "3"
      Schedule = @{
        ScheduleKind = "FrequencyBased"
        Interval = "PT3M"
      }
      Storage = @{
        StorageKind = "AzureBlobStore"
        FriendlyName = "Azure_storagesample"
        ConnectionString = "<connection string values>"
        ContainerName = "<Container Name>"
      }
      RetentionPolicy = @{
        RetentionPolicyType = "Basic"
        MinimumNumberOfBackups = "20"
        RetentionDuration = "P3M"
      }
     }
      $body = (ConvertTo-Json $BackupPolicy)
      $url = 'https://<ClusterEndPoint>:19080/BackupRestore/BackupPolicies/DailyAzureBackupPolicy/$/Update?api-version=6.4'
      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json' -CertificateThumbprint '<Thumbprint>'
      # User should update the name of backup policy [DailyAzureBackupPolicy being used here and other possible values accordinly].
    ```
4. Wait for 1-2 mins and policy should get updated across all entities.
5. Periodic backups will start happening as per backup policy.


## Key Announcements
* Azure Service Fabric will block deployments that do not meet Silver or Gold durability requirements starting on 10/30/2022. 5 VMs or more will be enforced with this change for newer clusters created after *10/30/2022* to help avoid data loss from VM-level infrastructure requests for production workloads.VM count requirement is not changing for Bronze durability. Enforcement for existing clusters will be rolled out in the coming months. <br> For details see: [Durability characteristics of the cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity#durability-characteristics-of-the-cluster). 
* Azure Service Fabric node types with VMSS durability of Silver or Gold should always have Windows update explicitly disabled to avoid unintended OS restarts due to the Windows updates, which can impact the production workloads. This can be done by setting the "enableAutomaticUpdates": false, in the VMSS OSProfile. Consider enabling Automatic VMSS Image upgrades instead. The deployments will start failing from *10/30/2022* for new clusters, if the WindowsUpdates are not disabled on the VMSS. Enforcement for existing clusters will be rolled out in the coming months. <br>
For more information see: [VMSS Image Upgrades](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-automatic-upgrade)

## Service Fabric Feature and Bug Fixes

| Versions | IssueType | Description | Resolution | 
|-|-|-|-|
| **Windows - 9.0.1107.9590<br>Ubuntu 18 - 9.0.1103.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 9.0.1103.1** | **Bug** | Service Remoting | **Brief Description**: Service Remoting does not honor the MaxConcurrentCalls setting due to which all the incoming service remoting calls are processed simultaneously.<br>**Impact**: MaxConcurrentCalls configuration of Service Remoting is allowing more calls to be processed than the given value.<br>**Fix**: MaxConcurrentCalls will limit the number of incoming service remoting calls to be processed concurrently. The default value of MaxConcurrentCalls setting is changed to 0 which implies that all the incoming service remoting calls would be processed concurrently by the service. Any non-zero value for MaxConcurrentCalls setting will limit the number of incoming service remoting calls being processed concurrently by the service.
| **Windows - 9.0.1107.9590<br>Ubuntu 18 - 9.0.1103.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 9.0.1103.1** | **Feature** | Backup Restore Service | **Brief Description**: BackupRestoreService (BRS) in Service Fabric is updated with new events for all backup and restore operations. This feature adds events for each intermediate state during backup and restore operations at partition level. BRS will also fire periodic events about backup and policies at partition and cluster level. These events can be viewed on Service Fabric Explorer.<br> **Documentation Reference**: Read more about it at - [BackupRestoreService events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-event-generation-operational) 

## Retirement and Deprecation Path Callouts
* Service Fabric ASP.NET Core packages built against ASP.NET Core 1.0 binaries are out of support. Starting Service Fabric 8.2, we will be building Service Fabric ASP.NET Core packages for .NET Core 3.1, .NET Core 5.0, .NET Core 6.0, .NET Framework 4.6.1. As a result, they can be used only to build services targeting .NET Core 3.1, .NET Core 5.0, .NET Core 6.0, >=.NET Framework 4.6.1 respectively.
For .NET Core 3.1, .NET Core 5.0, .NET Core 6.0, Service Fabric ASP.NET Core will be taking dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.App shared framework; whereas, for NetFx target frameworks >=.NET Framework 4.6.1, Service Fabric ASP.NET Core will be taking dependency on ASP.NET Core 2.1 packages.
The package Microsoft.ServiceFabric.AspNetCore.WebListener will no longer be shipped, Microsoft.ServiceFabric.AspNetCore.HttpSys package should be used instead.
* .NET 5.0 runtime has reached end-of-life on May 8, 2022. Service Fabric releases after this date will drop support for Service Fabric applications running with .NET 5.0 runtime. Current applications running on .NET 5.0 runtime will continue to work, but requests for investigations or requests for changes will no longer be entertained. Please migrate to using .NET 6.0 version instead.
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS reached its 5-year end-of-life window on April 30, 2021. Service Fabric runtime has dropped support for 16.04 LTS, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS. Current applications running on it will continue to work, but requests to investigate issues w.r.t this OS or requests for change will no longer be entertained. Service Fabric runtime has also dropped producing builds for U16.04 so customers will no longer be able to get SF related patches.
* Service Fabric runtime will soon stop supporting BinaryFormatter based remoting exception serialization by default and move to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception serialization by default. Current applications using it will continue to work as-is, but Service Fabric strongly recommends moving to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception instead.
* Service Fabric runtime will soon be archiving and removing Service Fabric runtime version 6.4 packages and older, as well as SDK version 3.3 packages and older from the package Download Center. Archiving/Removing will affect application scaling and re-imaging of virtual machines in a Service Fabric Cluster running on unsupported versions. After older versions are removed/archived, this may cause failure while rolling back when the current in-progress upgrade has errors.
