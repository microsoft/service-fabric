## Service Fabric Feature and Bug Fixes
This release includes quality improvements only and does not contain bug fixes to specific issue.

## Retirement and Deprecation Path Callouts
* As aligned with [Microsoft .NET and .NET Core - Microsoft Lifecycle | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core), SF Runtime has dropped support for Net Core 3.1 as of December 2022. For  supported versions see [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions#current-versions-1) and migrate applications as needed.
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will reach its 5-year end-of-life window on April 30, 2023. Service Fabric runtime will drop support for 18.04 LTS after the published date, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to supported versions listed here: [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions#supported-linux-versions-and-support-end-date)
* Service Fabric runtime will soon stop supporting BinaryFormatter based remoting exception serialization by default and move to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception serialization by default. Current applications using it will continue to work as-is, but Service Fabric strongly recommends moving to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception instead.
* Service Fabric runtime will soon be archiving and removing Service Fabric runtime version 6.4 packages and older, as well as SDK version 3.3 packages and older from the package Download Center. Archiving/Removing will affect application scaling and re-imaging of virtual machines in a Service Fabric Cluster running on unsupported versions. After older versions are removed/archived, this may cause failure while rolling back when the current in-progress upgrade has errors.
* Migrate Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) library to Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) library, since ADAL will be out of support after December 2022. This will impact customers using AAD for authentication in Service Fabric for below features:<ul><li>Powershell, StandAlone Service Fabric Explorer(SFX), TokenValicationService</li><li>FabricBRS using AAD for keyvault authentication</li><li>KeyVaultWrapper</li><li>ms.test.winfabric.current test framework</li><li>KXM tool</li><li>AzureClusterDeployer tool</li></ul>For more information see: [MSAL Migration] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-migration)
