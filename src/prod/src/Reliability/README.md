# Reliability

In order to make the services highly reliable, the Reliability subsystem allows creating “secondary” of a “primary” partition and provides replication infrastructure to replicate data between primary and secondary. The reliability subsystem reconfigures and rebalances the primary and secondary of partitions to provide reliability in the event of failures.
