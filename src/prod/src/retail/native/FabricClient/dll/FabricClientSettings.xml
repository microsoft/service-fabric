    <!-- Uncomment the section below to temporarily work around CRL accessibility issue.
         The following setting will disable checking of certificate revocation list.
         The risk is, FabricClient might be unknowningly talking to a server with revoked
         certificate, while assuming the communcation is secured. Alternatives to consider:
         1. Set up http proxy to make CRL URL accessible
         2. use self-signed server ceritificates and verify server certificate thumbprint 
         instead of common name on the client side.
