Votes,PropertyGroup,VoteConfig,None,Dynamic,PUBLIC,src\Federation\FederationConfig.h,A vote represents a single count towards a quorum of in a cluster. A vote is assigned to a vote owner(node) by a vote authority. Vote Authorities are typically nodes (seed nodes) in the cluster. A cluster needs a quorum of votes present to guarantee its health and ability to stay up.  Losing a quorum of votes will cause the cluster to go down. An alternative to seed nodes are SQL votes; where the vote authority is not a node in the Cluster; but a SQL Server instance. In this case; the node with the closest Id to the SQL vote Id acts as a proxy. The votes selected through configuration; must be the same across all nodes. ID is a string that is parsed into a long integer that represents the ID of the vote in the cluster. The Type can be one of two options: SeedNode or SqlServer; depending on the vote authority used by the cluster. Depending on the type is the format for the connection string. The connection string for SeedNode is the NodeEndpoint for the node with the same NodeID. For type=SqlServer is a connection string to a SQL Server 2008 and up. An example to a SeedNode is : '0 = SeedNode;10.0.0.1:10000'. An example to a SQL vote is: 'sqlvote1 = SqlServer;Provider=SQLNCLI10;Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Database=master;Integrated Security=SSPI'

Naming/Replication,BatchAcknowledgementInterval,TimeSpan,Common::TimeSpan::FromMilliseconds(0),Static,INTERNAL,src\Naming\NamingConfig.h,Specify timespan in seconds. Determines the amount of time that the replicator waits after receiving an operation before sending back an acknowledgement.

Setting this to false allows the replicator to optimistically acknowledge operations on behalf of the service. While true tells the replicator to require service ack via the Operation.Ack() API before the acknowledgement can be sent back to the primary service.

When persistent replicas come back from a down state; they may have already been replaced.  This timer determines how long the FM will keep the standby replica before discarding it.

This value should generally be set to some small fraction of the initial cluster size. 
FailoverManager,ClusterPauseThreshold,int,1,Static,PUBLIC,src\Reliability\Failover\FailoverConfig.h,If the number of nodes in system go below this value then placement; load balancing; and failover is stopped.

This setting defines the maximum number of actions which the FM will issue in a single iteration of the FM state machine.  Increasing this number will allow the FM to reconfigure the system faster when necessary (no actions will be held back); at the cost of additional resource consumption in terms of messages that are sent from the FM to the replicas and also the concurrent handling of those actions by all of the affected replicas).
